This project was done at University of Milan for "Biomedical Signal Processing" course, together with my collegue Katia Cracco. It is about Photoplethysmograph signal reconstruction with a novel approach for motion and artifact detection and correction, following two papers:

Part II: Motion and noise artifact removal. Ann Biomed Eng. 2014 Nov;42(11):2251-63. doi: 10.1007/s10439-014-1030-8. Epub 2014 May 14. PMID: 24823655.


It was done with Matlab. The first part is about how to detect Motion and Noise Artifacts on artificially built noisy signals exploiting four time-domain parameters. The second part exploits the SVD to reconstruct the signal maintaining the highest amount of information.
